Steps to Create a Windows Virtual Machine in Azure:

    Sign in to Azure Portal:
        Open a web browser and navigate to the Azure Portal.
        Sign in using your Azure account credentials.

    Navigate to Virtual Machines:
        In the Azure Portal, click on "Virtual Machines" in the left-hand menu or search for "Virtual Machines" in the search bar.

    Click on "Add" to Create a New VM:
        Click on the "+ Add" button to start creating a new virtual machine.

    Choose Basics Settings:
        Subscription: Select the Azure subscription to use (if you have multiple).
        Resource Group: Create a new resource group or select an existing one. Resource groups are used to manage and organize related Azure resources.
        Virtual Machine Name: Enter a name for your virtual machine.
        Region: Choose the Azure region where you want to deploy the virtual machine.
        Image: Select a Windows Server or Windows Client image from the Azure Marketplace (e.g., Windows Server 2019 Datacenter, Windows 10 Pro).

    Configure VM Size:
        Choose an appropriate size for your VM based on your workload requirements (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space). You can use the default size or click "Change size" to select a different size.

    Configure Administrator Account:
        Set a username and password for the administrator account of the virtual machine. This account will have administrative privileges on the VM.

    Configure Networking:
        Virtual Network: Choose an existing virtual network or create a new one.
        Subnet: Select a subnet within the chosen virtual network.
        Public IP: Decide whether to assign a public IP address to the VM (needed for remote access).

    Configure Management:
        Enable monitoring, diagnostics, backup, and other management options as needed.

    Advanced Settings (Optional):
        Customize additional settings such as extensions, boot diagnostics, availability options, etc.

    Review + Create:
        Review the configuration settings for your VM.
        Click "Create" to deploy the virtual machine.

    Deployment Process:
        Azure will now start deploying the virtual machine based on the specified configuration.
        You can monitor the deployment progress in the Azure Portal.

    Accessing the Virtual Machine:
        Once the deployment is complete, you can connect to the Windows VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or other methods.
        Use the public IP address (if assigned) and the administrator credentials to log in to the VM.
