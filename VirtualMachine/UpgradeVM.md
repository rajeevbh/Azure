Steps to Change the Size of a Virtual Machine in Azure:

    Sign in to Azure Portal:
        Open a web browser and navigate to the Azure Portal.
        Sign in using your Azure account credentials.

    Navigate to Virtual Machines:
        In the Azure Portal, click on "Virtual Machines" in the left-hand menu or search for "Virtual Machines" in the search bar.

    Select the Virtual Machine:
        Locate the virtual machine whose size you want to change from the list of VMs.
        Click on the VM to open its details.

    Stop the Virtual Machine (if required):
        If the VM is running, you may need to stop it before changing the size.
        In the VM's overview pane, click on "Stop" to deallocate the VM.

    Resize the Virtual Machine:
        In the VM's overview pane, click on "Size" under the Settings section.

    Choose a New Size:
        A list of available VM sizes will be displayed. Select the desired VM size that meets your requirements (e.g., more CPU cores, memory, disk space).
        Note: Not all sizes may be available for resizing depending on the VM's location and resource availability.

    Apply the New Size:
        After selecting the new VM size, click "Resize" to apply the changes.
        Azure will initiate the resizing process, which may take a few minutes to complete.

    Start the Virtual Machine:
        Once the resizing process is finished, start the VM by clicking on "Start" in the VM's overview pane (if it was stopped).

    Verify the Changes:
        Once the VM is running, verify that the new VM size is applied successfully.
        You can check the updated configuration (CPU, memory) in the VM's overview pane.
