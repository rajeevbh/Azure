Steps to Delete a Data Disk from an Azure Virtual Machine:

    Sign in to Azure Portal:
        Open a web browser and navigate to the Azure Portal.
        Sign in using your Azure account credentials.

    Navigate to Virtual Machines:
        In the Azure Portal, click on "Virtual Machines" in the left-hand menu or search for "Virtual Machines" in the search bar.

    Select the Virtual Machine with Attached Data Disk:
        Locate the virtual machine that has the data disk you want to delete from the list of VMs.
        Click on the VM to open its details.

    Identify the Data Disk to Delete:
        In the VM's overview pane, click on "Disks" under the Settings section.
        Note down the name of the data disk that you want to delete (e.g., mydatadisk).

    Stop the Virtual Machine (if required):
        If the VM is running, you may need to stop it before deleting the data disk.
        In the VM's overview pane, click on "Stop" to deallocate the VM.

    Detach the Data Disk from the Virtual Machine:
        In the VM's overview pane, click on "Disks" under the Settings section.
        Find the data disk you want to delete and click on it to open its details.
        In the Disks pane, to the far right of the data disk that you would like to detach, select the detach button to detach.
        Click on "Detach" at the top to detach the data disk from the VM.
        Confirm the detachment when prompted.

    Navigate to Disks:
        In the Azure Portal, click on "Disks" in the left-hand menu or search for "Disks" in the search bar.

    Select and Delete the Data Disk:
        Locate the data disk you detached from the VM in the list of disks.
        Click on the data disk to open its details.
        Click on "Delete" at the top to initiate the deletion process.
        Confirm the deletion when prompted.

    Verify Deletion:
        After deleting the data disk, ensure that it's no longer listed in the Disks section of the Azure Portal.

    Start the Virtual Machine (if required):
        Once the data disk is successfully deleted, go back to the VM's overview pane.
        Click on "Start" to start the VM (if it was stopped).
